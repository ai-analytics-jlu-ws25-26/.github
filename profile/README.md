# Applied AI in Risk and Finance

Welcome to the official course website for **Applied AI in Risk and Finance**!

## Course Outline

This **hands-on course** is designed to equip you with the essential skills to apply AI methods and models to real-world use cases. Below is the course description sourced and adapted from the [course repository](https://github.com/ai-analytics-jlu-ws25-26/course):

> This seminar is aimed at PhD students eager to explore how various subfields of Artificial Intelligence are applied in practice. Unlike typical PhD courses, this seminar emphasizes how advanced methods that originated from research can be leveraged to solve practical problems in finance and risk management. My goal is to bring you up to speed with practical tools, techniques, and frameworks that will benefit your future professional endavoursâ€”whether in academia or industry. While traditional graduate courses focus heavily on theory, this course prioritizes **bridging the gap between theory and practice**. We will cover essential topics such as version control (Git), data cleaning and visualization, Python programming, and, most importantly, the application of AI techniques from Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI).

## Prerequisites

All course code is written in **Python**. While coding is not the primary focus and much complexity is abstracted through functions and classes, having some prior experience with Python or any other object-oriented programming language is recommended. This will allow you to focus on the AI concepts and applications without getting bogged down by programming basics.

To help you gauge your Python skills, Iâ€™ve prepared a short [self-assessment quiz](https://github.com/ai-analytics-jlu-ws25-26/python-quiz) featuring simple Python programming tasks. There is no gradingâ€”just a way for you to check your readiness. If you find the tasks challenging, consider brushing up on Python basics before starting. A great resource is this engaging, free 2-hour crash [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5KVEU3aaeQ) for complete beginners.

## Discussion Forum

Throughout the course, you might encounter questions or technical issues that arenâ€™t easily resolved by yourself. For these moments, the course offers a [**discussion forum**](https://github.com/orgs/ai-analytics-jlu-ws25-26/discussions) where you can post questions related to the material or setup. This forum serves as place to connect with peers, share solutions, and collaborate. Often, others have faced similar challenges and can offer helpful advice.

I will regularly monitor the forum to answer open questions, but please feel empowered to help each other as well. Together, we can create a supportive learning community and get the most out of this course.

## Technical Setup

All required software is **open-source and free**. Please aim to complete installation before the first lecture. I will be available to assist with setup issues in the week prior to the start of the course via the [discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/ai-analytics-jlu-ws25-26/discussions).

### Python

We will use **Python 3.12** throughout the course (download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/)). Our primary development environment will be **JupyterLab**, which you will install as part of the virtual environment setup. If you prefer, you can also use other IDEs like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.

### Git and GitHub

We will use **Git** for version control (install instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)) and **GitHub** for hosting and collaboration (create an account [here](https://github.com/join)). While this course is not focused on Git, basic Git operations like cloning repositories will be part of this course.

Beyond this course, I highly recommend learning Git for your own projects. Git helps you track changes, collaborate efficiently, and supports open science and reproducibility. Many journals now require reproducible research, and GitHub simplifies this with direct integrations to the journals' submission platforms. Personally, I host all my research code, teaching materials, and even my website on GitHub.

## FAQ

### How do I download the material and stay updated?

This course is continuously evolving with new content added from time to time. To simply view lecture slides or HTML notebooks, use the [Lectures](#lectures) links above. Each lecture is organized in a numbered folder (e.g., `1_ml`).

To run the code locally (highly recommended), clone the repository using Git and regularly pull updates. If youâ€™re new to Git, this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/courses/python-git-github-intro/) provides a helpful introduction.

### I found a mistake or want to contribute

Please [open a new issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) via the [discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/ai-analytics-jlu-ws25-26/discussions). Even better, fork the repo and submit a pull request via [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). Contributions are very welcome, though responses may be slower while the course is under development. Note that I may not provide software or conceptual support to non-enrolled students, but others in the community might help.

### Can I use or adapt this material for my own course?

Absolutely! Thatâ€™s why everything is publicly available. I only ask two favors:<br>
1. Please let me know by email at [me@juliandoerr.com](mailto:me@juliandoerr.com) if you use or find the material helpful.<br>
2. Please include an acknowledgment in your syllabus or notes.

### Are you available to teach this course at my organization?

Possibly! Feel free to [contact me](mailto:me@juliandoerr.com) to discuss.

### What tools do you use to produce these lecture slides and notebooks?

All of the lecture material is written in Jupyter Notebooks. For the html slidesow I am using the [jupyter nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert) extension which allows to convert Jupyter Notebooks into various other formats.
