# Applied AI in Risk and Finance

Welcome to the official course website for **Applied AI in Risk and Finance**!

## Course Outline

This is a **hands-on AI course** taught by [Julian Dörr](https://juliandoerr.com/) designed to equip you with the essential skills to apply AI methods and models to real-world challenges. Below is the course description sourced from the [course repository](https://github.com/ai-analytics-jlu-ws25-26/courses):

> This seminar is aimed at PhD students eager to explore how various subfields of Artificial Intelligence are applied in practice. Unlike typical PhD courses, this seminar emphasizes how cutting-edge research methods can be leveraged to solve real-world problems in finance and risk management. My goal is to bring you up to speed with practical tools, techniques, and frameworks that will benefit your career—whether in academia or industry. While traditional graduate courses focus heavily on theory, this course prioritizes **bridging the gap between theory and practice**. We will cover essential topics such as version control (Git), data cleaning and visualization, Python programming, and, most importantly, the application of AI techniques from Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI).

**Please read the full README before diving into the lectures.** It contains important details on software requirements, installation instructions, and a comprehensive overview of the course’s aims and scope.

## Prerequisites

All course code is written in **Python**. While coding is not the primary focus and much complexity is abstracted through functions and classes, having some prior experience with Python or any object-oriented programming language is highly recommended. This will allow you to focus on the AI concepts and applications without getting bogged down by programming basics.

To help you gauge your Python skills, I’ve prepared a short self-assessment quiz featuring simple Python programming tasks. There is no grading—just a way for you to check your readiness. If you find the tasks challenging, consider brushing up on Python basics before starting. A great resource is this engaging, free 2-hour crash [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5KVEU3aaeQ) for complete beginners.

## Discussion Forum

Throughout the course, you might encounter questions or technical issues that aren’t easily resolved by research or AI assistants. For these moments, the course offers a **discussion forum** where you can post questions related to the material or setup. This forum is a fantastic place to connect with peers, share solutions, and collaborate. Often, others have faced similar challenges and can offer helpful advice.

I will regularly monitor the forum to answer open questions, but please feel empowered to help each other as well. Together, we can create a supportive learning community and get the most out of this course.

## Technical Setup

All required software is **open-source and free**. Please aim to complete installation before the first lecture. I will be available to assist with setup issues during the first week via the discussion forum.

### Python

We will use **Python 3.12** throughout the course (download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/)). Our primary development environment will be **JupyterLab**, which you will install as part of the virtual environment setup. If you prefer, you can also use IDEs like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.

### Git and GitHub

We will use **Git** for version control (install instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)) and **GitHub** for hosting and collaboration (create an account [here](https://github.com/join)). While this course is not focused on Git, basic Git operations like cloning repositories will be essential.

Beyond this course, I highly recommend learning Git for your own projects. Git helps you track changes, collaborate efficiently, and supports open science and reproducibility. Many journals now require reproducible research, and GitHub simplifies this with DOI integration and licensing options. Personally, I host all my research code, teaching materials, and even my website on GitHub.

## FAQ

### How do I download the material and stay updated?

This course is continuously evolving with new content added weekly. To simply view lecture slides or HTML notebooks, use the [Lectures](#lectures) links above.

To run the code locally (highly recommended), clone the repository using Git and regularly pull updates. If you’re new to Git, these [slides](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/02-git/02-Git.html) provide a helpful introduction. Each lecture is organized in a numbered folder (e.g., `1_ml`).

### I found a mistake or want to contribute

Please [open a new issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). Even better, fork the repo and submit a pull request via [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). Contributions are very welcome, though responses may be slower while the course is under development. Note that I may not provide software or conceptual support to non-enrolled students, but others in the community might help.

### Can I use or adapt this material for my own course?

Absolutely! That’s why everything is publicly available. I only ask two favors:  
1. Please let me know by email at [me@juliandoerr.com](mailto:me@juliandoerr.com) if you use or find the material helpful.  
2. Please include an acknowledgment in your syllabus or notes.

### Are you available to teach a condensed version of this course at my institution?

Possibly! Feel free to [contact me](mailto:me@juliandoerr.com) to discuss.

### What tools do you use to produce these lecture slides and notebooks?

(Answer to be added here if needed.)
